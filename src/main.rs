/// This cherry-picks a commit onto a new branch crated from default branch.
/// A typical use case is when one wants to quickly create a fix without leaving
/// the current branch. The quickfix-commit will then be cherry-picked onto a new
/// branch based-off origin/main. The benefit of this tool is that slow, expensive
/// and disruptive switching of branches is avoided. Everything is done in-memory
/// with no checkout of files on the file system.
///
/// Usage:
///
/// 1. Commit the changes
/// 2. git quickfix <new-branch>. This will create a new branch from the default branch.
///     `--push` will directly push this to the `origin` remote.
///     `--keep` will keep the quickfix commit on the current branch.
/// 3. The changes will be removed from the current branch, unless `--keep` was given to quickfix.
///
/// Benefits: Quickly provide unrelated fixes without having to abandon the current branch and switching branches.
