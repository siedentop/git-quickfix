## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Prevent loss of data in case of uncommitted changes. I profoundly apologize to
  the effected user. [PR#2](https://github.com/siedentop/git-quickfix/pull/2).
  Thanks to Sebastian Buck (@betwo) for the changes.

### Added

- Option `--force` overwrites an existing branch. (Use `git reflog` in case of
  inadvertent use.)
- Option `--stash` auto stashes unstaged changes. Thanks to Sebastian Buck
  (@betwo) for the idea and implementation.

## [0.0.3] - 2020-10-03

### Removed

- Removed `--force` option to overwrite branches. It would be possible to
  provide this again in the future, please let me know if you want it.

### Changed

- Changes should already be committed. Thus it behaves now as something akin to
  `cherry-pick --onto`.
- Provide alias `git qf`.
- Try to read the default remote branch automatically. Unfortunately, still
  hard-coding main, master, devel (in that order).

### Fixed

- Pick up the git repo also from subdirectories.
- Reduce binary size.
- Reset starting branch.

## [0.0.2] - 2020-09-23

- Logging is used instead of println.
- color_eyre is used for error handling

## [0.0.1] - 2020-09-22

### Added

- Initial Release
